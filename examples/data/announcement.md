**Project Summary – `PromptObjects`**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project name** | PromptObjects |
| **Version** | 0.1.0 |
| **Status** | Alpha |
| **Key Features** | • Unified capability interface<br>• YAML front‑matter configuration<br>• LLM‑backed prompt objects<br>• Deterministic primitives<br>• Message bus logging<br>• Human‑in‑the‑loop support |

> The JSON file defines a new project centered on an extensible prompt‑object system, with various features aimed at simplifying prompt management, logging, and human oversight. The project is currently in an **alpha** development stage.

**Highlights**

- **Unified Capability Interface** – Seamlessly integrate LLM-backed prompts and deterministic primitives.
- **YAML Front‑Matter** – Simple, human‑readable configuration for prompt objects.
- **LLM‑Backed Prompt Objects** – Leverage language models directly from structured prompts.
- **Deterministic Primitives** – Stable, deterministic operations for tasks like file I/O and data manipulation.
- **Message Bus Logging** – Centralized logging for all prompt-object interactions.
- **Human‑in‑the‑Loop Support** – Easily inject human decisions for oversight and control.

Project: PromptObjects Framework Analysis

Key Concepts:
- Everything is a capability (unified interface)
- Prompt objects are markdown files with LLM-backed behavior
- Primitives are Ruby code with deterministic execution
- Message bus tracks all inter-capability communication
- Human-in-the-loop for confirmation and clarification

Technical Stack:
- Ruby for core implementation
- RubyLLM for LLM adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama)
- YAML frontmatter for configuration
- Markdown body becomes system prompt

Status: Active development
